## Some General Advice

Below I have included a number of resources for learning Python3. Some
of the resources present (or attempt to present) a comprehensive
overview while others focus on particular topics.

__If you are completely new to coding__ I recommend you start with
one of the comprehensive online courses like the "Crash Course on Python
by Google" listed below. Then continue with the following resources.

__If you have some familiarity with Python__ I recommend reviewing the
"Python Programming Beginner Tutorials by Corey Schafer", the format of
a playlist will let you pick and choose where to spend your time. Once
you are familiar with the basics of Python coding review the videos
"Using DesignSafe's JupyterHub and Python for Natural Hazards Research"
to become familiar with using JupyterLab and the
"Matplotlib Tutorial Playlist by Corey Schafer" to learn how about
plotting. After completing these you may find my personal notes
"Python 3 - A Non-Traditional Approach" helpful.

*For this course please select the "Audit this course" option. By
auditing the course you will be provided the course materials for free,
but you will not receive the course certificate (which is fine you do
not need it). If, however, you want the certificate for personal reasons
you can pay the fee, just be aware you will not be reimbursed.
