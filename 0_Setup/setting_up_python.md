# Setting up a python installation
>Joseph Vantassel, University of Texas at Austin

## 1. Getting Started

 1. Install the newest version of python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

 2. Choose and install a development environment. _Note that the setup for each
    IDE is different, and so follow the documentation provided by each for
    setting the path to the python installation._
    - vscode is highly recommended [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
      + If using vscode, take advantages of the extension especially pylint.
    - winpython is also recommended (if using a PC).[winpython.github.io](https://winpython.github.io/).
      + Nice because it already includes a version of python and all of the
        "standard" packages, as well support for JupyterNotebook and JupyterLab.

 3. Once your IDE is configured install the basic packages that will be helpful.
    A list of a few useful packages and their references are in the
    JupyterNotebook _setuppy.ipynb_. __TODO__ add a text file with dependencies, 
    such that `pip install recommended_packages.txt` will perform the necessary
    installation.
