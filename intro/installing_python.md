1. Visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. Select `Downloads>Windows`. If you are not using Windows select your
appropriate operating system.

3. Find the release you are want by scrolling through the __Stable Releases__.
_Note: Releases (also known as versions) of Python follow the
`major.minor.micro` convention. More information on Python versioning can be
found [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/)_.

4. Once you have found the version you want. Select the approprate installer.
For modern computers with a Windows operating system this will be
`Windows x86-64 executable installer`.

5. Download the installer and save it to your `Downloads` directory.

6. Run the installer, by double clicking the downloaded installer.
__Important:__ Be sure to check the `Add Python to Path` box on the first
page of the installer. This will ensure that the Python version you are
installing will be findable through the terminal.

7. Follow the installer instructions.

8. Check Python installed correctly by opening a terminal, either Windows
Powershell (recommended) or Command Prompt on a Windows machine, and enter
`python --version` you should see the name of the Python version that you
selected in step 4. For example, if you downloaded Python 3.7.5 you should see
`Python 3.7.5` printed to the console. _Note: If you do not see the correct version
number or you get an error that the program `python` cannot be found, this means
that either the installation was not sucessful or that Python was not added to
the path, refer to step 6. If this is the case uninstall the software and repeat
the above steps, paying special attention to follow all of the directions._

9. Enjoy!
