1. [Install a modern Python interpreter](./installing_python.md) if you have not
done so previously.

2. Open a terminal, either Windows Powershell (recommended) or Command Prompt on
a Windows machine, and enter `pip install jupyter`.

3. Ensure Jupyter installed correctly by reading the last few lines printed
to the console.

4. To run Jupyter in a particular directory. First, open a terminal in that
directory then enter `jupyter notebook` into the terminal. A Jupyter notebook
interface will then open shortly in a web-brower. Double-click any notebook
(i.e., files ending in `.ipynb`) to begin.

5. Enjoy!
