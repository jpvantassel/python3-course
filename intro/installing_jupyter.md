1. [Install a modern Python interpreter](./installing_python.md) if you have not
done so previously.

2. Open a terminal, either Windows Powershell (recommended) or Command Prompt on
a Windows machine, and enter `pip install jupyterlab`.

3. Ensure JupyterLab installed correctly by reading the last few lines printed
to the console.

4. To run Jupyter in a particular directory. First, open a terminal in that
directory then enter `jupyter lab` into the terminal. The Jupyter Lab
interface will then open shortly in a web-browser. Double-click any notebook
(i.e., files ending in `.ipynb`) to begin.

5. Enjoy!
