## Executive Summary

This repository is a collection of independent modules to explain topics of
interest to a programmer who is new to Python, though not strictly new to
programming in general.

These modules mostly focus on the technical aspects of utilizing and
contributing to the Python eco-system and improving the quality of your current
Python programs. These modules are not meant to teach you how to code
(e.g., explaining how a for loop work) as it is assumed the reader already has a
fundemental understanding of programming in some language though not strictly in
Python. If you are not familar with any programming langauge and have not
programmed prior to finding this course many other high-quality resources are
available and would be a more appropriate place to begin.

To get the most out of this course skip to those sections which you find the
most interesting/useful, and leave the others until they become relavant to you.
Check back regularly to see if new modules have been added or if previously
skipped modules have recently become revalent.

All the best,

\- Joe
