    "- The `Classic` and `Updated` images are different in many ones these include:\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Classic Jupyter Image`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses the classic JupyterNotebook interface.\n",
    "- Default Python version is 3.6.\n",
    "- Over 100 Python packages installed by default.\n",
    "- Additional Bash and R kernel.\n",
    "- __Will be kept available permanently.__\n",
    "- __Not recommened for new projects.__\n",

    "## Path Forward\n",
    "\n",
    "- Installing every package requested by users was untenable in the long-term because of version lock and version promiscuity, see [semver.org](https://semver.org/).\n",
    "- DesignSafe needed a more flexbile approach that allowed users to control and direct their own code dependencies.\n",
    "- Two main approaches for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 1: Effemoral User Installations (Recommended for most users)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- Users need to explicitly define their dependencies.\n",
    "- By including the `pip` or `conda` installation syntax, notebooks are less tied to the environment in which they were developed.\n",
    "- As a result notebooks become more self-contained and more future proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Since installations inside of DesignSafe are tied to their Jupyter session, users must reinstall packages everytime they shutdown and restart their server.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Approach 2: Custom User-Defined Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Users can persist kernels between sessions, saving time on startup.\n",
    "- Users can run multiple Python interpreters with multiple custom enviornments.\n",
    "- Users can share kernels (e.g., between professors and students, between collaborators on a project).\n",
    "- Users can publish kernels alongside their notebooks for use by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disdavantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can be more time consuming than `pip` installing from scratch if there is only a small number of packages.\n",
    "    \n",
    "> For most users Approach 1 is the way to go. For those who are interested in having the extra functionality of Approach 2 the rest of the notebook introduces the _kerneltuility_."
