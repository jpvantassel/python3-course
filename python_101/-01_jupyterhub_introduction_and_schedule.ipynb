    "- Jupyter allows you to combine code, plots, and mardown into a single document.\n",
    "- Jupyter is a great tool for teaching and communicating your results to a broad audience.\n",
    "- Jupyter is a great tool for making easy-to-use user interfaces.\n",
    "- Jupyter is not a great tools for developing serious Python scripts or packages. I put that dividing line at about 200 - 300 lines of code. For those who are interested a humerous talk about some of the challenges with notebooks [see this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U)."
